# Algorithms and Datastructures

In this project I am using Modern C++ to implement my own datastructure and algorithms

## Folder and file structure

**modules/include** is the public section of the library where the unit interface modules lay.

**modules/src** is the private section of the library where the implementations lay.

## C++ Modules and CMake
I am using C++ Modules (C++20) and CMake to build these modules.
